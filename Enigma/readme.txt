Enigma Emulator... sort of

To play around with it, import the project and run it from main. A command line interface will show up asking for
configuration. Give it any combination of 3 capital letters or numbers to set the initial position for the Enigma. After this,
input capital letters or numbers one by one to get their encoded values.

It (unintentionally) created a World War 2 feeling cuz you actually have to copy them down on paper! This is because
I had no time to hack together a GUI also.

After you have copied the sentence down, suppose someone receives it and wants to decode it, she can just configure
her Enigma to the same config and input the letters one by one, and the message comes out decoded!

This is the most standard 3-rotor, fixed-reflector Enigma with no extra accessories. The complexity of this assignment
could come from the implementation of multiple models. This hack currently is not designed to meet those challenges.
